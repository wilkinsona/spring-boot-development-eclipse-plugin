## Spring Boot development Eclipse plugin

Eclipse plugin that helps with the development of Spring Boot. Some capabilities are:

 - Warns about `@Configuration` classes that use field injection
 - Warns about unnecessary use of `@Autowired` on classes with a single constructor
 - Quick fix for converting a configuration class from constructor injection to field injection
 - Reports an error if a `FailureAnalyzer` is not listed in `META-INF/spring.factories`
 - Warns about the use of `@Component` in main code
 - Warns about public or protected functional interfaces in main code that are not annotated
   with `@FunctionalInterface`
 - Warns about single parameter lambda expressions that do not enclose the parameter in
   parentheses
 - Quick fix for enclosing a lambda expression's single parameter in parentheses
 - Warns about lambda expressions with a block body containing a single statement
 - Warns about unused method parameters in main code
 - Reports an error if a usage of AssertJ's `assertThat(â€¦)` is incomplete
 - Warns about packages in main code that contain public or protected classes but no
   `package-info.java` file
 - Warns if a javadoc `@link` to an annotation does not use `@AnnotationName` as the
   link's text
 - Warns if fail() is used in a try-block or assertThat() is used in a catch block,
   recommending the use of AssertJ's exception assertion support instead
 - Reports an error if an unproxied `@Bean` method is called directly
 - Warns when a `@Bean` method is declared on a non-`@Configuration` class
 - Warns when a non-`@Configuration` class extends a class with `@Bean` methods
 - Reports an error when a `@Configuration` class that disables bean method proxying
   extends a `@Configuration` class that uses bean method proxying
